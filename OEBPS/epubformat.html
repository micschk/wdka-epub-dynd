<p>This epub consists of four lectures by Jeroen van Erp (Fabrique), Alper Çuğun (Monsterswell), Irene van Peer (Pig Chase), Tom de Bruyne and Astrid Groenewege (Sue Amsterdam). All lectures have been tagged according to five keywords: <a href='./thema1.html'>behaviour</a>; <a href='./thema4.html'>experience</a>; <a href='./thema5.html'>process</a>; <a href='./thema3.html'>new aesthetics</a> and <a href='./thema2.html'>storytelling</a>. This arrangement allows a non lineair and thematic reading of the event.</p>
<p>The keywords reflect the main topics  of all four lectures, representing Dynamic Design. The keywords can be used to navigate through snippets of all lectures. Each snippet offers a link to the complete lecture, including bio's and slides of the speakers.</p>
<h3>About the keywords</h3>
<p>One of the main keywords is behaviour. This term covers important aspects of dynamic design such as game design and the construction of "choice architectures", as discussed by Irene van Peer and Sue Amsterdam. Jeroen van Erp (Fabrique) talks about experience design for clients. He explains how brands use experience as a way to connect media and services, turning their designs into an addictive and complete experience. Irene van Peer from Pig Chase addresses experience in her lecture from a designer's perspective: "Experience in dynamic design is about making as opposed to thinking. Making is needed to provide some understanding of how your idea will actually operate". At the same time she explains the intuitive experience that is build into the game Pig Chase, that connects humans and pigs.
Alper Çuğun introduces another interesting perspective on dynamic design; the procedural. In his lecture he discusses how behaviour is designed by machines through algorithms. Alper shows how design products have an intended application that is constructed through software. It is important to be aware of that.
Finally, Alper refers to  'new aesthetic', a term which describes the possibility of exchanging aesthetics belonging to either the physical or the data world.</p></div>
