      <h1>About the epub format</h1>
    </div>
 
      <p>This epub is a publication of the dynamic design event at the Unie Rotterdam, organised by Crosslab WdKa. It consists of four lectures that are organised around five keywords: <a href="">behaviour</a>; <a href="">experience</a>, <a href="">process</a>; <a href="">dynamic data</a> and <a href="">designer</a>. These keywords represent the main topics that are weaved through all four <a href="">lectures</a>. The keywords can be used to navigate through snippets of all four lectures. Vervolgens, Every snippet offers a link to the complete lecture, including bio and slides of the presenter. 
      One of the main keywords is behaviour. This term covers important aspects of dynamic design such as game design and the construction of choice architectures.</p>  

      <p>Another important theme is experience. Irene van Peer from Pig Chase addresses experience in her <a href="">lecture</a> from a designer's perspective: Experience in dynamic design is about making as opposed to thinking. Making is needed to provide some understanding of how your idea will actually operate.
      Jeroen van Erp explains how brands use experience as a way to connect media and services and turn their designs into an addictive and complete experience.
      Alper Cugun introduces another interesting perspective of dynamic design, which is the processual. In his lecture he discusses how behaviour is designed by machines through algorithms. Alper shows how design products have an intended application that is constructed through software and it is important to be aware of that.</p>

      <p>Finally, the term 'dynamic data' is about how the digital transforms behaviour and thus design because it allows machines to track behaviour and in that way "transforms the way we make decisions".[Tom de Bruyne]
