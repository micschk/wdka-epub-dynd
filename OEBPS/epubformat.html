			<h1>About the epub format</h1>
		</div>

		<p>This epub is a publication of the dynamic design event at the Unie Rotterdam, organised by Crosslab WdKa. It consists of four lectures that are organised around five keywords: <a href="">behaviour</a>; <a href="">experience</a>, <a href="">process</a>; <a href="">dynamic data</a> and <a href="">designer</a>. These keywords represent the main topics that are weaved through all four <a href="">lectures</a>. The keywords can be used to navigate through snippets of all four lectures. Vervolgens, Every snippet offers a link to the complete lecture, including bio and slides of the presenter. 
			One of the main keywords is behaviour. This term covers important aspects of dynamic design such as game design and the construction of choice architectures.</p>  

		<p>Another important theme is experience. Irene van Peer from Pig Chase addresses experience in her <a href="">lecture</a> from a designer's perspective: Experience in dynamic design is about making as opposed to thinking. Making is needed to provide some understanding of how your idea will actually operate.
			Jeroen van Erp explains how brands use experience as a way to connect media and services and turn their designs into an addictive and complete experience.
			Alper Cugun introduces another interesting perspective of dynamic design, which is the processual. In his lecture he discusses how behaviour is designed by machines through algorithms. Alper shows how design products have an intended application that is constructed through software and it is important to be aware of that.</p>

		<p>Finally, the term 'dynamic data' is about how the digital transforms behaviour and thus design because it allows machines to track behaviour and in that way "transforms the way we make decisions".[Tom de Bruyne]

        <h2>Quotes</h2> 
		[Tom de Bruyne]
		<p>How can we trigger behaviour, how can we trigger someone to become excited about a brand, start to talk about it, start to share their opinion. We want to argue that the traditional tool-set that we use, that is, communication, is definitely not the most relevant, interesting, or remarkable. We think that there are three much more interesting tools to use, tools that are much more embedded in design than they are in advertising. Behavioural economics, game design, and the third area, or idea, we think you should consider, is persuasion design.</p>

		[Jeroen van Erp]
		<p>Firstly, something which is perhaps very simple: the digital revolution has impregnated every area of society, if in 2040 we look back at this period it may be even more recognisable as a pivotal point in history. Like the industrial revolution, technology changes economics, social life, human behaviour, essentially everything, and I think designers play a very important role in this.</p>

		[Astrid Groenewege]
		<p>We always say that advertising is very much about seduction, if you compare it to a relationship, if somebody is hitting on you constantly you loose interest, but if somebody has some mysterious quality, then you want to get at that mysterious quality and so want engage with them. This is how you should think about brands, don't think about the seduction game, the advertising game, but how to make the brand remarkable, and relevant for people.</p>
