			Coming back to reality, we have <a>3D printing</a>, objects scanned by digital 3D scanners, and then printed out into reality with the same reproducible quality of digital reproduction. There was an installation which was composed of nothing more than the entire content of Flickr, or at least some portion of Flickr. 
		</p>
		<p>
			What does all this tell us? It tells us that these things share something in common, and that commonality is, I think, they are all made from <a>algorithms</a>, algorithms of some complexity.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each of these algorithms has been programmed by an author and so have inherited the values of that author, that is, in a way, is how computers work, and its increasingly how the world works. An earlier lecture talked about behaviour, Robert Fabricant said that our medium is behaviour. Algorithms herald a shift into more procedural time, where media are not so much descriptive but prescriptive, they set rules for how the world should work. The scary, or uncertain, part comes from the fact that these are all closed systems, algorithms do stuff, they have inputs and outputs, be we have no way of knowing, in any meaningful way, what happens in-between, we can make guesses, be we relate to the world in a human way and algorithms are alien to us, they operate in ways that are essentially non-human, and the more complex they are the more difficult it is for us to make sense of what they do. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There are algorithms designed to recognise faces, and with this we have trained an algorithm to recognise some part of the world as we see it, perhaps at some stage this same algorithm will be applied for some other purpose, for example, detecting faces where there really are none, and the point is, if you program these algorithms you get results that you can not really predict, who knows where there might be "faces". If you can not predict them, and I'm sure we would all agree that there are parts of our lives where predictability is desirable, how can we foresee what results they might have? Algorithms are used to calculate stock market fluctuations, if at a certain point a number of stocks crash the market, it may be increasingly difficult to understand why, as such events happen in a fraction of a second, and this is problem for everything which depends on such a system to be stable and behave predictably.
		</p>
		<p>
			Humans can fill some of the gaps created by algorithms, at least the gaps which algorithms allow us to fill, but they are mostly independent actors who allow us some breathing space here and there, spaces in which they need us to accomplish their aims, a space within the algorithm for us.

			how do we know we are not following robotic fish?</p>

			There is a <a>robotic fish</a> that its authors have trained, or algorithmically programmed, to behave just as a fish does. It was so good at "being a fish" that the shoal of fish it was introduced to started to follow the robotic fish, believing it to be a real fish, and this brings me to pose the question: how do we know we are not following robotic fish? The things that we use to make decisions, how do we know these decisions are based on "human sense" and not on some vague algorithmic "statistical sense". This is perhaps our challenge, how do we design systems that harness the open and generative power of the Internet and at the same time humanise the non-human internals of the algorithm, or at least have it be an informed relation so that we are not blindsided by unpredictability. There is no magic bullet for such a challenge, as this is the difficultly that comes with design, but I'd like to quote Graham Harman from his book the <a>Prince of Networks</a>, talking about an engineer building a tunnel, he says: "[...] the engineer must negotiate with the mountain at every stage of the project, testing to see where the rock resists and where it yields, and is quite often surprised by the behaviour of the rock."
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the skill of working. I don't really believe there is one specific idea that will solve all such problems, or products that will magically fix things that have failed in their <a>intended application</a>, I only believe there will be work through which we will gain more understanding, and hopefully, make better things.
		</p>
		<p>
			With that said, I wish you all "good work", thank you.
