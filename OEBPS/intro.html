      <p>An evening about design as a dynamic and procedural phenomenon. How do digital platforms like smart phones or games affect the user's behavior?  And how could you design this behavior or experience? Examples of this type of "immaterial design" include service design or experience design: a stairway as an experience, a trashcan as a game. Representatives from the field of gaming, interaction design and advertising will shine their light on 'Dynamic Design'. Sue Amsterdam is a'creative agency for the future'. Their credo: "We design behaviour". Jeroen van Erp (Fabrique) will focus on experience design for clients.  And finally, game designers Hubbub will show how to design interaction with pigs.</p>

    <h2>Jasper Schelling intro</h2> (misschien dit in vorm van video, kan dat technisch?)
      <p>The speakers all share one common relation, they are no longer the designers of products but the designers of processes, processes that aim to change people's behaviour.</p>

      <p>
      Traditionally, it has been the fields of Industrial Design and Interaction Design that have experience with involving an audience with their design process, however, with the advent of the digital age we see that the need to involve an audience is becoming increasing more relevant for other disciplines. The key to understanding an audience is discovering what values are important to them. For this reason empathy is a requisite for the designer who is interested in involving an audience. The designer has to use empathy to gain insight into the audience, it is then a question of the designer being able to synthesise these insights, and use them to develop original and inventive solutions that are meaningful to that audience. Most of the audience here, at least I assume, will have a background in the arts, and excel in creating aesthetic experiences that challenge an audience, however, when your aim is to inspire change and influence the behaviour of people you need a different set of methods.</p>

    <h2>Quotes</h2> 
      [Tom de Bruyne]
      <p>How can we trigger behaviour, how can we trigger someone to become excited about a brand, start to talk about it, start to share their opinion. We want to argue that the traditional tool-set that we use, that is, communication, is definitely not the most relevant, interesting, or remarkable. We think that there are three much more interesting tools to use, tools that are much more embedded in design than they are in advertising. Behavioural economics, game design, and the third area, or idea, we think you should consider, is persuasion design.</p>

      [Jeroen van Erp]
      <p>Firstly, something which is perhaps very simple: the digital revolution has impregnated every area of society, if in 2040 we look back at this period it may be even more recognisable as a pivotal point in history. Like the industrial revolution, technology changes economics, social life, human behaviour, essentially everything, and I think designers play a very important role in this.</p>

      [Astrid Groenewege]
      <p>We always say that advertising is very much about seduction, if you compare it to a relationship, if somebody is hitting on you constantly you loose interest, but if somebody has some mysterious quality, then you want to get at that mysterious quality and so want engage with them. This is how you should think about brands, don't think about the seduction game, the advertising game, but how to make the brand remarkable, and relevant for people.</p>
