					Behaviour
				<div class='short'>
					Behaviour is that which activates and enriches design. To design behaviour is a challenge since it deals with intuitive and unsuspected actions and reactions from people, objects or even animals. In case of Dynamic Design, behaviour is the core element that determines the flow and content of design projects. Since behaviour is a fluid content for design it is crucial that prototyping and user-testing is embedded in the design process. To design behaviour asks for smart, intuitive and flexible design solutions. The research that is part of Dynamic Design is about analysing common choice architectures to eventually be able to bend it instead of manipulating it.

				Pigs are very intelligent and easily bored, this boredom can lead to violent behaviour, such as tail and ear biting. We asked ourselves whether this should be a game for pigs, as a cognitive challenge, or whether it should be a game between humans, or a game between humans and pigs, might this game be able to transform the relation between humans and animals. So, this past year we worked on a <a epub:type="noteref" href="#n1" >concept video</a> in which we tried to present how this game might be employed, or played.
			</p>
			<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/honey.jpg'/></div>
			<p>
				The video was our very first goal, its nice to talk about how we got there, because it may shine some light on what factors influenced the design, the design process, and the dynamics of this design process.
			</p>
			<p>
				I feel its very important to get as close as possible to the users, in this case we have two groups of users, we have the pigs and the humans. By getting close to the users you can begin to frame ideas. The idea that began to evolve, and which we felt very strongly about, was the idea that because pigs need variation in order to avoid getting bored, a source of that variation could be offered by humans, in a sense, the human would become a source of entertainment. From this idea we began to start paper <a>prototyping</a>, which I think is very important in the design process. At a later stage we created a <a>mock-advertisement</a> to try and get some idea of how to position the game, we considered various magazines and how the readers of those magazines would react to the game and the experience we were trying to create ... have you played with a pig lately?

				First, lets start with an anecdote.
				<a>"Keep the Change"</a>, a program which is designed on top of Bank of America's debit card. What this service does is, whenever you pay for a coffee, say, it rounds up the amount paid to a decimal, so if the coffee costs 3.20 it rounds the figure up to 4.00, with the additional 0.80 cents being transferred into a savings account in your name. Its quite shocking to see how quickly money can accumulate by saving in this way. So, it takes a basic human desire as a point of departure ... people all want to save, but they don't know how. Designers or banks can communicate as much they like but it doesn't make it any easier for savers. This particular design intervention got more then 100,000 people to switch to Bank of America, its designed for behavioural change, it triggers people to save without having to do anything.
			</p><p>
				The first conclusion we can make from this is that if you compare advertising with the science of behavioural economics, you see that advertising, as an industry, clings to a naive conviction that people will change their behaviour if they are informed, so all the advertiser need do is communicate with them.
			</p><p>
				Some examples to illustrate this point:

				This is a brilliant intervention intended to prevent guys from missing the urinal, its a miniature goal with a small ball that can be aimed at, the use is obvious, but perhaps the purpose isn't.
			</p><p>
				Another example, which we discovered while on holiday, is a "Mind Your Head" type sign, it says "Mind Head Device", and it was clipped above the entrance of a airplane, quite a small airplane. Again, its not a communication thing, its putting the solution in place of the communication.
			</p><p>
				A year ago HIVOS, <a>Humanistisch Instituut voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking</a>, did a campaign with the idea that people here in the Netherlands should reduce energy consumption, the campaign was dreadful, it says "He thanks you for not using your dry-cleaners", actually, the first iteration said, "He thanks you for not using your shower". This is really, really, bad advertising because people reacted negatively toward it, the thought is: "now its my fault that the third world having all kinds of problems ... because I shower too much?"
			</p><p>
				What if we somehow twist the <a>choice architecture</a> in which we all operate, could we trigger unconscious behaviour that results in fulfilling or intended goal, but without the direct act of instruction?
			</p><p>
				Students in Utrecht created a "light gun", a fun way to shoot out lights. If you shoot the gun at a light in your house it turns the light off, the gun is a one way switch so it couldn't be used to turn the lights on again, you would have to get up out of your chair, and walk to the switch, to turn the light back on. Its a fun way of approaching the same problem of energy use, but its designed to be transparent to the user.

				The second area that fascinates us is <a>game design</a>, and game design has absolutely nothing to do with games, and nothing to do with gamification. Games are not fun because they are games, but because they are well designed. Game design is about designing behaviour, and about designing interesting choices.
				A game designer we know, Sabastian Deterding visited a music academy, and this is what he said, "if I look at a music academy through the eyes of a game designer, I see a totally broken game, everything looks like a school, it smells like a school", if we compare this to a game like <a>Guitar Hero</a>, which mimics the process of learning to play an instrument, there is a difference, the game is designed to trigger you to master the instrument so that you get hooked in trying to get better at it.
