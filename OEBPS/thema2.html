				If we imagine a cone with four levels, and we take it to represent an undertaking for a client, these four levels: the undertaker, the strategist, concept developer, and at the bottom, the designer, represent is a classic design commission: we have a strategy, come up with a concept, and make a design. What you see is at the top there is the thinking and at the bottom there is the doing, at the top its about creating business and at the bottom about creating designs, and further, at the top its about <a>storytelling</a> and the bottom products and service systems. The interesting thing is that as you move up your outreach is bigger, but whats more important, because such tasks have greater independence, as a strategist, you move around and are forced to get out of your comfort zone. This is where I think the role of the designer has to move toward, to a medium independent creative thinker, instead of a doer. The new role for the designer: a thinker, a strategist, a conceptualist, a business creator, a philosopher.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why the designer? Because of his or her creativity, from this perspective we are much more powerful than classical consultants, we can look at things from a more holistic point of view, we have the ability to challenge, the ability to connect the thinking and doing, we can act on all levels and make things fit, and we can bring together company concerns with user and consumer concerns, but only if the designer gets out of the comfort zone.

			<p>BIO Jeroen challenges technology to find answers to human needs. The roots of this approach can be found in her study at the TU-Delft/Faculty of Industrial Design and at the Design Academy where she graduated cum laude in â€™87.
				Initially working at design offices (including working for nine years at Landmark design and technology) she now has her own design studio.(2000)</p>
			<p>Her main focus has been in projects for the medical and healthcare sector. These projects vary from working with medical specialists developing joint prostheses to a project in the townships of South Africa focussing on sanitation problems. Starting with Sofos, a bench for a waiting area, she went on to design a whole range of project furniture for Eromes.</p>
			<p>
				In addition Irene has been involved in projects developing future visions, looking for a unifying concept such as in the intelligent kitchen for Atag; new food concepts for hospitals and lately an identity vision for Eromes.
