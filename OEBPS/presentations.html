This evenings series of lectures will be on the subject of Dynamic Design: how design is becoming increasingly immaterial due to the growing importance given to the process of design. The moderator of this evening will be Jasper Schelling, and so let me welcome Jasper to the podium.[Deanna Herst]</p>

<p>
First of all, thank you all for being here, I'm pleased that you find the subject of this lecture of such interest that you are willing to sacrifice the pleasures of the beautiful weather outside.  


As Deanna stated, these short lectures are on the subject of Dynamic Design, the speakers all share one common relation, they are no longer the designers of products but the designers of processes, processes that aim to change people's behaviour.[Jasper Schelling]</p>


<p>Traditionally, it has been the fields of Industrial Design and Interaction Design that have experience with involving an audience with their design process, however, with the advent of the digital age we see that the need to involve an audience is becoming increasing more relevant for other disciplines. The key to understanding an audience is discovering what values are important to them. For this reason empathy is a requisite for the designer who is interested in involving an audience. The designer has to use empathy to gain insight into the audience, it is then a question of the designer being able to synthesise these insights, and use them to develop original and inventive solutions that are meaningful to that audience. Most of the audience here, at least I assume, will have a background in the arts, and excel in creating aesthetic experiences that challenge an audience, however, when your aim is to inspire change and influence the behaviour of people you need a different set of methods.</p></div>

			<span class='fullname'>SUE Amsterdam</span>
			SUE Amsterdam is a creative marketing agency. Sue designs behavior. They seduce and persuade; they trigger and convert. Sue develops smart ideas, not funny ideas. They are fond of brands that inevitably bubble up wherever people are looking for them. SUE Amsterdam aims to be the creative agency of the future.
			SUE was founded on January 1st 2012 by Astrid Groenewegen, Tom De Bruyne and Mirelle Janssen, previously known as managing partners of Boondoggle Amsterdam (best interactive agency of 2011 in the Netherlands).

			<p>

				Hi, I am Tom and this is Astrid, we founded a company call <a href="http://sueamsterdam.com/">Sue Amsterdam</a> only a few months ago, before this we were managing an agency called <a href='http://boondoggle.eu'>Boondoggle</a>. We're going to talk about persuasion eating advertising for breakfast, basically what we want to talk about are the mechanisms of ruling the world. We want to talk about the secret of becoming a successful creative in the digital era.
			</p>
			<p>In our vision digital has absolutely nothing to do with media, for us, digital is something totally different, digital for us is a change in behaviour, a change in buying behaviour, if you look at it from a marketing perspective. We look at how the digital transformed the world, and how the digital has transformed you, and how the digital has transformed the way we make decisions, whether that be decisions on where to travel, where to eat, what to buy, etc, all these decisions are influenced by the fact that we are hyper-connected with each other, and with each others opinions, reviews, ratings, search results, etc, etc.</p>

			<p>How can we trigger behaviour, how can we trigger someone to become excited about a brand, start to talk about it, start to share their opinion. We want to argue that the traditional tool-set that we use, that is, communication, is definitely not the most relevant, interesting, or remarkable. We think that there are three much more interesting tools to use, tools that are much more embedded in design than they are in advertising.</p> 

			<p>First, lets start with an anecdote.</p>
<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/allslides/slidessue/sue_howtriggerbehaviour_Page_04.jpg'/></div>
			<p>Keep the Change, a program which is designed on top of Bank of America's debit card. What this service does is, whenever you pay for a coffee, say, it rounds up the amount paid to a decimal, so if the coffee costs 3.20 it rounds the figure up to 4.00, with the additional 0.80 cents being transferred into a savings account in your name. Its quite shocking to see how quickly money can accumulate by saving in this way. So, it takes a basic human desire as a point of departure ... people all want to save, but they don't know how. Designers or banks can communicate as much they like but it doesn't make it any easier for savers. This particular design intervention got more then 100,000 people to switch to Bank of America, its designed for behavioural change, it triggers people to save without having to do anything.</p>

			<p>The first conclusion we can make from this is that if you compare advertising with the science of behavioural economics, you see that advertising, as an industry, clings to a naive conviction that people will change their behaviour if they are informed, so all the advertiser need do is communicate with them.</p>

			<p>Some examples to illustrate this point:</p>

			<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/allslides/slidessue/sue_howtriggerbehaviour_Page_08.jpg'/></div>

			<p>This is a brilliant intervention intended to prevent guys from missing the urinal, its a miniature goal with a small ball that can be aimed at, the use is obvious, but perhaps the purpose isn't.</p>

			<p>Another example, which we discovered while on holiday, is a "Mind Your Head" type sign, it says "Mind Head Device", and it was clipped above the entrance of a airplane, quite a small airplane. Again, its not a communication thing, its putting the solution in place of the communication.</p>

			<p>A year ago HIVOS, <a href='http://www.hivos.nl'>Humanistisch Instituut voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking</a>, did a campaign with the idea that people here in the Netherlands should reduce energy consumption, the campaign was dreadful, it says "He thanks you for not using your dry-cleaners", actually, the first iteration said, "He thanks you for not using your shower". This is really, really, bad advertising because people reacted negatively toward it, the thought is: "now its my fault that the third world having all kinds of problems ... because I shower too much?"</p>

			<p>What if we somehow twist the choice architecture in which we all operate, could we trigger unconscious behaviour that results in fulfilling or intended goal, but without the direct act of instruction?</p>

			<p>Students in Utrecht created a "light gun", a fun way to shoot out lights. If you shoot the gun at a light in your house it turns the light off, the gun is a one way switch so it couldn't be used to turn the lights on again, you would have to get up out of your chair, and walk to the switch, to turn the light back on. Its a fun way of approaching the same problem of energy use, but its designed to be transparent to the user.</p>

			<p>I think advertising is obsessed with "telling", with creating communication to tell a story, but there is a certain numbness that people have in relation to advertising. What we want to suggest is that "involving" is more interesting, because when you involve people, they have to experience, and so understand and remember without the need to be told to do so.</p>
<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/allslides/slidessue/sue_howtriggerbehaviour_Page_11.jpg'/></div> 
			<p>The second area that fascinates us is game design, and game design has absolutely nothing to do with games, and nothing to do with gamification. Games are not fun because they are games, but because they are well designed. Game design is about designing behaviour, and about designing interesting choices.</p>

			<p>A game designer we know, Sabastian Deterding visited a music academy, and this is what he said, "if I look at a music academy through the eyes of a game designer, I see a totally broken game, everything looks like a school, it smells like a school", if we compare this to a game like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero' > Guitar Hero</a>, which mimics the process of learning to play an instrument, there is a difference, the game is designed to trigger you to master the instrument so that you get hooked in trying to get better at it.</p>
<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/allslides/slidessue/sue_howtriggerbehaviour_Page_16.jpg'/></div>
			<p>So, we have behavioural economics, game design, and the third area, or idea, we think you should consider, is persuasion design. A book by <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini'>Robert B. Cialdini</a> "50 Scientifically Proven Ways to Be Persuasive", an easy read but something that offers a lot in terms of areas, or methodologies, that design and advertising has overlooked.</p>

			<p>

				We always say that advertising is very much about seduction, if you compare it to a relationship, if somebody is hitting on you constantly you loose interest, but if somebody has some mysterious quality, then you want to get at that mysterious quality and so want engage with them. This is how you should think about brands, don't think about the seduction game, the advertising game, but how to make the brand remarkable, and relevant for people.[Astrid Groenewege]</p>

			<p>

				To all you advertising people, don't consider yourselves to be advertising creatives, your creatives that take human understanding as a point of departure and design for behavioural change, you design solutions around understanding human behaviour.

				That's is! ... thank you.[Tom de Bruyne]</p>
