Alper Cugun M.Sc. (1981, Dutch/Turkish) is a designer, technologist, publicist and early adopter. He was one of the first ten Dutch Twitter users and heâ€™s always looking to find and build new things. Currently Alper is intendant of data visualization agency Monster Swell, CTO of game studio Hubbub and on the board of Hack de Overheid
After graduating he started a collective donations startup TipiT that contributed significantly to Wikileaks among other initiatives. He brought Foursquare to Amsterdam as its first international city shortly after the service had launched in the United States. And with an exploration of physical computing he won first prize at Music Hack Day Amsterdam.

 <p>Hello ...
   
   I don't plan to say a lot about <a href='http://monsterswell.com/blog/'>Monsterswell</a>and the kind of projects we are working on, I will show some work here and there, but I will mainly focus on this thing called "the new aesthetic", an idea that seems to have infested our minds, at least it has the minds of myself and those around me. This subject has been occupying my thought a lot recently, I'm really not sure what it means, but I think there is something about the concept that is important. I intend to show you some material and try and relate it to the ideas developed around this "new aesthetic".</p>

<p>This is the office of Monsterswell[COMMENT insert image of office for continuity], in Berlin, we are a company that makes maps. As you can see, the office itself is something of a map, at least if one compares it to many of the maps that I will present later on during this lecture. Maps themselves are increasingly askew, the maps that we might be used to have become less and less typical. However there are more interesting maps now than perhaps there ever have been, at least in terms of the diversity of the ways in which information is presented.</p>

<p>[COMMENT insert image of "routing based on geo-tag density" (00:01:10) image: https://secure.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/6747484741/] 
  
  This map show Internet routing based on geo-tag density from Twitter, it represents the likely paths that Internet traffic will take in and out of Manhattan, New York.</p>

<p>[COMMENT insert image of "Google experiment" (00:01:21) image https://secure.flickr.com/photos/alper/7178004962/]
  
  This map, which is a Google project, somewhat similar to <a href='http://www.mapnificent.net/'>Mapnificent</a>, is a map in which London hotels are mapped based on travel distance.</p>

<p>[COMMENT insert image of Amsterdam "Time Maps" (00:01:34) image http://www.flickr.com/photos/acscherp/6162818009/ ]
  
  This map was a commission by Monsterswell, and produced by Arjan Scherpenisse[COMMENT name checked and correct] and Vincent Meertens[COMMENT name checked and correct], it shows the time required to travel in and around Amsterdam, an altogether different type of map.</p>

<p>Maps can be all kinds of things, they can be models of a territory, arguments about how a territory can be visualised, or work to relate how the territory is perceived. Every map has an inherent value judgement connected with it.</p>

<p>Maps have, until recently, been considered mostly unproblematic, but there has been some kind of a shift brought about by the capacity of digital technology to reverse how maps are projected, we now see maps projected back on to the real world. One particular example of this is Google's Augmented Reality Browser, you might know it as <a href='http://www.layar.com/what-is-layar/'>Layar</a>. Layar's are maps, but not necessarily maps of geographic data, we might say simply, they are mappings. Google is also mapping the real world with <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View'>Street View</a>, but given such information, if you try to overlay this mapping back onto reality you get all kinds of strange clashes, which is perhaps what happens when you try and use computers to capture a capricious world, certain mis-mappings occur.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most pernicious of mis-mapping is the Quick Response, or <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code'>QR Code</a>. QR codes we designed to enable the machine readable world, but these hardly have any real world use, there are QR Codes placed in such places that it would be impossible to scan them without killing yourself. Perhaps they are not so much to be used, but work as cultural icons, precursors of a strange and inscrutable future. In china, there is a QR code of huge proportions located in the desert that is used to calibrate spy satellites, so, satellites read the QR Code from space and use it calibrate their own geo-location, which is something of a feedback loop, maps projected on the earth used to better survey the earth.[COMMENT we could get into image overload but perhaps the Chinese QR code of 00:03:45 could be inserted here].</p>

<p>So, what happened? We put the Internet into maps, and that caused all kinds of bizarre feedback loops, but if we think about it maps are not the only place where we have transposed the Internet, it is becoming increasingly visible everywhere, its in my pocket for instance. So, the digital is having an effect back on the world, sometimes I'm not sure what to make of it.</p>

<p>There is a cover of an issue of the New Yorker Magazine that replicates the "loading" icon, and sculptural works in which pixialisation replaces the 3D sculpture with a mesh of squares, and furniture designed to replicate what could perhaps previously only have been viewed in Auto CAD, it all mimics the visual aesthetic of the digital world.</p>

<p>Coming back to reality, we have 3D printing, objects scanned by digital 3D scanners, and then printed out into reality with the same reproducible quality of digital reproduction. There was an installation which was composed of nothing more than the entire content of <a href='http://www.flickr.com'>Flickr</a>, or at least some portion of Flickr.</p> 

<p>What does all this tell us? It tells us that these things share something in common, and that commonality is, I think, they are all made from algorithms, algorithms of some complexity.</p>

<p>Each of these algorithms has been programmed by an author and so have inherited the values of that author, that is, in a way, is how computers work, and its increasingly how the world works. An earlier lecture talked about behaviour, Robert Fabricant said that our medium is behaviour. Algorithms herald a shift into more procedural time, where media are not so much descriptive but prescriptive, they set rules for how the world should work. The scary, or uncertain, part comes from the fact that these are all closed systems, algorithms do stuff, they have inputs and outputs, be we have no way of knowing, in any meaningful way, what happens in-between, we can make guesses, be we relate to the world in a human way and algorithms are alien to us, they operate in ways that are essentially non-human, and the more complex they are the more difficult it is for us to make sense of what they do.</p> 

<p>There are algorithms designed to recognise faces, and with this we have trained an algorithm to recognise some part of the world as we see it, perhaps at some stage this same algorithm will be applied for some other purpose, for example, detecting faces where there really are none, and the point is, if you program these algorithms you get results that you can not really predict, who knows where there might be "faces". If you can not predict them, and I'm sure we would all agree that there are parts of our lives where predictability is desirable, how can we foresee what results they might have? Algorithms are used to calculate stock market fluctuations, if at a certain point a number of stocks crash the market, it may be increasingly difficult to understand why, as such events happen in a fraction of a second, and this is problem for everything which depends on such a system to be stable and behave predictably.</p>

<p>Humans can fill some of the gaps created by algorithms, at least the gaps which algorithms allow us to fill, but they are mostly independent actors who allow us some breathing space here and there, spaces in which they need us to accomplish their aims, a space within the algorithm for us.</p>

<p>There is a <a href='http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120301113345.htm'>robotic fish</a> that its authors have trained, or algorithmically programmed, to behave just as a fish does. It was so good at "being a fish" that the shoal of fish it was introduced to started to follow the robotic fish, believing it to be a real fish, and this brings me to pose the question: how do we know we are not following robotic fish? The things that we use to make decisions, how do we know these decisions are based on "human sense" and not on some vague algorithmic "statistical sense". This is perhaps our challenge, how do we design systems that harness the open and generative power of the Internet and at the same time humanise the non-human internals of the algorithm, or at least have it be an informed relation so that we are not blindsided by unpredictability. There is no magic bullet for such a challenge, as this is the difficultly that comes with design, but I'd like to quote Graham Harman from his book the <a href='http://www.re-press.org/book-files/OA_Version_780980544060_Prince_of_Networks.pdf'>Prince of Networks</a>, talking about an engineer building a tunnel, he says: "[...] the engineer must negotiate with the mountain at every stage of the project, testing to see where the rock resists and where it yields, and is quite often surprised by the behaviour of the rock."</p>

<p>This is the skill of working. I don't really believe there is one specific idea that will solve all such problems, or products that will magically fix things that have failed in their intended application, I only believe there will be work through which we will gain more understanding, and hopefully, make better things.
  
  With that said, I wish you all "good work", thank you.</p>
