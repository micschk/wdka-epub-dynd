       Irene van Peer challenges technology to find answers to human needs. The roots of this approach can be found in her study at the TU-Delft/Faculty of Industrial Design and at the Design Academy where she graduated cum laude in â€™87.
Initially working at design offices (including working for nine years at Landmark design and technology) she now has her own design studio.(2000)
Her main focus has been in projects for the medical and healthcare sector. These projects vary from working with medical specialists developing joint prostheses to a project in the townships of South Africa focussing on sanitation problems. Starting with Sofos, a bench for a waiting area, she went on to design a whole range of project furniture for Eromes.
In addition Irene has been involved in projects developing future visions, looking for a unifying concept such as in the intelligent kitchen for Atag; new food concepts for hospitals and lately an identity vision for Eromes.

 Hello ...

You have heard a lot of different perspectives so far this evening, but with this lecture I would like to relocate you and have your feet re-planted in the mud, as I'm going to talk about a game we're developing, a game played between pigs and humans, we call it <a href='http://playingwithpigs.nl'>Pig Chase</a>.
</p>
<p>As in any collaborative project many parties are involved, so let me introduce these parties. The project is a collaboration between two institutes, Utrecht School of the Arts, this group is composed of Kars Alfrink, an Interaction Designer, Hein Lagerweij, an Emotion Designer, and myself, an Industrial Designer, coupled with this group is the schools research team, led by Marinka Copier. The second institute involved is Wageningen University, with Marc Bracke, an animal behaviourist, and Clemens Driessen, an applied philosopher.</p>

<p>So, as you see, there a quite a lot of people involved, but we still needed further collaborators, farmers and of course, most importantly, pigs.</p>

<p>Pigs are very intelligent and easily bored, this boredom can leads to violent behaviour, such as tail and ear biting. We asked ourselves whether this should be a game for pigs, as a cognitive challenge, or whether it should be a game between humans, or a game between humans and pigs, might this game be able to transform the relation between humans and animals. So, this past year we worked on a concept video in which we tried to present how this game might be employed, or played.</p>
<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/allslides/slidesirene/pigs.003.jpg'/></div>
<p>
  
  The video was our very first goal, its nice to talk about how we got there, because it may shine some light on what factors influenced the design, the design process, and the dynamics of this design process.</p>
<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/allslides/slidesirene/pigs.007.jpg'/></div>
<p>I feel its very important to get as close as possible to the users, in this case we have two groups of users, we have the pigs and the humans. By getting close to the users you can begin to frame ideas. The idea that began to evolve, and which we felt very strongly about, was the idea that because pigs need variation in order to avoid getting bored, a source of that variation could be offered by humans, in a sense, the human would become a source of entertainment. From this idea we began to start paper prototyping, which I think is very important in the design process. At a later stage we created a mock-advertisement to try and get some idea of how to position the game, we considered various magazines and how the readers of those magazines would react to the game and the experience we were trying to create ... have you played with a pig lately?</p>
<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/allslides/slidesirene/pigs.006.jpg'/></div>
<p>
  
  Its not the design yet, but it does show the experience the game should give, the feeling of being connected to the pigs, as if you might be able to touch them through the screen. This is what we were aiming at, the experience someone might have when entering a pig pen, some kind of contact.</p>

<p>When we went back to the pig pen ourselves, we weren't looking for conformation, we went there with an open mind and open to surprises. What we tried to do was consider all the senses, we really wanted to get the pigs attention and be able to hold that attention, a stable relation between action and reaction, something we could build a game on. We presented the pigs with light, and were really surprised at what happened, they became really interested in the lights, and this, in time, became the best solution for getting the pigs attention, and where we eventually focused.</p>

<p>To make design decisions, and to think through the details, for instance, whether the light should be focused or blurred, is important, but you also need to make something that can be tested, and so making, as opposed to thinking, is needed to provide some understanding of how your idea will actually operate. We needed to do this because we needed to find the kinds of materials that would provide the right kind of light, and variation, that would interest the pigs.</p>

<p>It was important for us that our goal was not to enable factory farming, but to provide some experience of closeness to the pigs, and to have people think about boredom and give the pigs some active role.
  
  We're currently in the process of the next phase of what I would like to call new design dynamics.
