			<div class='title'>New Aesthetics
				<div class='short'>New aesthetic refers to the migratory behaviour of aesthetics, from real to virtual and currently  also vice versa. Now that we have digital fabrication technologies at our disposal, digital screen aesthetics can be applied to physical objects. These visual migrations seem to embody an new visual language that unites the codes of both the physical and the virtual domain. As Alper Çuğun pointed out: "We can see examples and applications coming back to reality, we have 3D printing, objects scanned by digital 3D scanners, and then printed out into reality with the same reproducible quality of digital reproduction."

				This is the office of <a href='http://monsterswell.com'>Monsterswell</a>, in Berlin, we are a company that makes maps. As you can see, the office itself is something of a map, at least if one compares it to many of the maps that I will present later on during this lecture. Maps themselves are increasingly askew, the maps that we might be used to have become less and less typical. However there are more interesting maps now than perhaps there ever have been, at least in terms of the diversity of the ways in which information is presented.

				This map show Internet routing based on <a href='#notemap1' epub:type='noteref'>geo-tag density from Twitter</a>, it represents the likely paths that Internet traffic will take in and out of Manhattan, New York.
				This map, which is a Google project, somewhat similar to Mapnificent, is a map in which London hotels are mapped based on travel distance.
				This map was a commission by Monsterswell, and produced by Arjan Scherpenisse and Vincent Meertens, it shows the time required to travel in and around Amsterdam, an <a href='#notemap2' epub:type='noteref'>altogether different type of map</a>.

				Maps can be all kinds of things, they can be models of a territory, arguments about how a territory can be visualised, or work to relate how the territory is perceived. Every map has an inherent value judgement connected with it.
				Maps have, until recently, been considered mostly unproblematic, but there has been some kind of a shift brought about by the capacity of digital technology to reverse how maps are projected, we now see maps projected back on to the real world. One particular example of this is Google's Augmented Reality Browser, you might know it as 
<a epub:type='noteref' href='#note-layar' >Layar</a>. Layar's are maps, but not necessarily maps of geographic data, we might say simply, they are mappings. Google is also mapping the real world with Street View, but given such information, if you try to overlay this mapping back onto reality you get all kinds of strange clashes, which is perhaps what happens when you try and use computers to capture a capricious world, certain mis-mappings occur.
			</p>
			<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/losseplaatjes/hand.jpeg'/></div>
			
			<p>
				Perhaps the most pernicious of mis-mapping is the Quick Response, or <a epub:type='noteref' href='#note-QR' >QR Code</a>. QR codes we designed to enable the machine readable world, but these hardly have any real world use, there are QR Codes placed in such places that it would be impossible to scan them without killing yourself. Perhaps they are not so much to be used, but work as cultural icons, precursors of a strange and inscrutable future. In china, there is a QR code of huge proportions located in the desert that is used to calibrate spy satellites, so, satellites read the QR Code from space and use it calibrate their own geo-location, which is something of a feedback loop, maps projected on the earth used to better survey the earth.
			</p>
<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/losseplaatjes/QRcode_frompage.jpg'/></div>
			<p>
				So, what happened? We put the Internet into maps, and that caused all kinds of bizarre feedback loops, but if we think about it maps are not the only place where we have transposed the Internet, it is becoming increasingly visible everywhere, its in my pocket for instance. So, the digital is having an effect back on the world, sometimes I'm not sure what to make of it.

<div class='inlineimg' ><img src='images/allslides/slidesalper/alper_04.jpg'/></div>

				There is a cover of an issue of the <a href='#notemap3' epub:type='noteref'>New Yorker Magazine </a>that replicates the "loading" icon, and sculptural works in which pixialisation replaces the 3D sculpture with a mesh of squares, and furniture designed to replicate what could perhaps previously only have been viewed in Auto CAD, it all mimics the visual aesthetic of the digital world.

Layar is a Dutch company based in Amsterdam, founded in 2009 by Raimo van der Klein, Claire Boonstra and Maarten Lens-FitzGerald. They have created a mobile browser called Layar. The browser allows users to find various items based upon augmented reality technology.
Augmented reality AR is a way viewing digital information which has been superimposed – or augmented – onto a live view of the physical, real-world environment around you.

<aside epub:type="footnote" id="note-QR">
QR Code (abbreviated from Quick Response Code) is the trademark for a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional code) first designed for the automotive industry. More recently, the system has become popular outside the industry due to its fast readability and large storage capacity compared to standard UPC barcodes. The code consists of black modules (square dots) arranged in a square pattern on a white background.
Formerly confined to industrial uses, they have in recent years become common in consumer advertising and packaging, because the dissemination of smartphones "has put a barcode reader in everyone's pocket" for the first time. As a result, the QR code has become a focus of advertising strategy, since it provides quick and effortless access to the brand's website.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code
The reason why they are more useful than a standard barcode is that they can store (and digitally present) much more data, including url links, geo coordinates, and text. The other key feature of QR Codes is that instead of requiring a chunky hand-held scanner to scan them, many modern cell phones can scan them.

				In our vision digital has absolutely nothing to do with media, for us, digital is something totally different, digital for us is a change in behaviour, a change in buying behaviour, if you look at it from a marketing perspective. We look at how the digital transformed the world, and how the digital has transformed you, and how the digital has transformed the way we make decisions, whether that be decisions on where to travel, where to eat, what to buy, etc, all these decisions are influenced by the fact that we are hyper-connected with each other, and with each others opinions, reviews, ratings, search results, etc, etc.
